## Code Structure
Tech Stack:
- SQLite3
- Express
- React
- Node

I built this game as a Full-Stack Web Application utilizing the Model-View-Controller architecture. MVC allows for rapid development as it ensures the separation of concerns within the codebase based on application logic, thus increasing its maintainability and scalability without sacrificing flexibility throughout the development process. MVC also works well with the Test Driven Development philosophy as its modular nature allows for relatively straightforward unit testing.

### Directories
#### Client
Contains files related to the frontend of the web application
- **dist**: holds files generated by Webpack and served to the client by the express server
- **src**: holds react components and styles.css which are bundled using Webpack and transpiled with Babel to ensure backwards compatibility before being served to the client machine
#### Server
Contains files related to the backend of the web application
- **controllers**: Contains functions invoked when a request is received and routed by the express server. These functions invoke model functions that interact with the database and then perform any logic required to transform the data received from the database before sending a response to the client.
- **db**: Contains functions that create the SQLite3 database and games table based on the supplied schema (if it does not exist) and exports a connection to the models such that the model functions can execute queries.
- **models**: Contains functions that interact with the database to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data.
- **index.js**: The express server that routes requests received by the server and serves responses as well as files found in the ../client/dist directory
- **mastermind.db**: the SQLite3 directory
